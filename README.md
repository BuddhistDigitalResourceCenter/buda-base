# buda-base
Base platform for BUDA development

The base platform is built using Vagrant and VirtualBox.

1) Install Vagrant and VirtualBox. 

2) Download or **git clone** this repository.

3) cd into the project

4) vagrant up

This will grind awhile. The Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is installed followed by Oracle JDK 8; couchdb and its dependencies; jena/fuseki; elastic search; tomcat; and RabbitMQ.

Only JDK 8 and couchdb are currently installed.
